Mobile Water is a simple water prefab that allows you to quickly add a high performance water feature to your scene, it is one draw call and has been tested on iPhone 3gs,4 4S, iPad 1 + 2  and android.

To use simply drag a prefab into a scene and adjust the parameters :

// speed of water
speed
// transparency of water.  
// 0 is transparent 
// 1 is opaque
alpha

// size of wave texture
waveScale;

Changing Textures
You can also change the textures by clicking on a material and updating the image, it doesn't need to be an alpha transparent image


*** Version 1.1 ***
Added waves ability. This is a more intensive script so fall fack to flat water version (See WaterMobileTestSimple) if your scene is processor intensive
